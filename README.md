**PROJECT 1** 


**Title:** [global health record project](global health record project.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft excel (data cleaning, pivot table, slicers,  get pivot data, dashboard, pivot charts, data visualisation) 

**Project Description:** This project involves analysing a global health dataset that spans various countries, years, and disease categories. The objective is to investigate trends in disease prevalence, incidence, mortality, and recovery rates, along with other socioeconomic factors such as education index, urbanization, and income levels. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights into global health challenges and identify areas for improvement in healthcare systems. The dashboard includes the following features:
Top 10 countries with highest prevalence rate: it shows the top 10 countries with high prevalence rate
age group affected by disease: this explains how disease affects based on the age group
prevalence rate by gender: this explains how prevalence rate happens in genders
Average of Recovery Rate (%) based on disease category: this explains the rate at which people recover based on age 
average healthcare access over the years with Age group 
Average Treatment Cost (USD) by disease category
Average of Healthcare Access (%) by country
sum of income per country (top 5) 


**Key findings:** Prevalence and Incidence Trends: Diseases like COVID-19 and Ebola showed varying rates of prevalence and incidence across regions, with noticeable spikes in specific years.
Mortality and Recovery Rates: High mortality rates are associated with diseases such as Ebola, while diseases like COVID-19 had relatively high recovery rates in recent years.
Socioeconomic Correlations: Countries with higher per capita income and education indices tended to have lower disease prevalence rates and higher vaccine availability.
Urbanization and Health: Urbanization rates appeared to impact the incidence of certain diseases, indicating a potential link between urban density and health outcomes.
