#PROJECT 1


**Title:** [global health record project](global health record project.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft excel (data cleaning, pivot table, slicers,  get pivot data, dashboard, pivot charts, data visualisation) 

**Project Description:** 

This project involves analysing a global health dataset that spans various countries, years, and disease categories. The objective is to investigate trends in disease prevalence, incidence, mortality, and recovery rates, along with other socioeconomic factors such as education index, urbanization, and income levels. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights into global health challenges and identify areas for improvement in healthcare systems. 

**The dashboard includes the following features:**

Top 10 countries with highest prevalence rate: it shows the top 10 countries with high prevalence rate

Age group affected by disease: this explains how disease affects based on the age group

prevalence rate by gender: this explains how prevalence rate happens in genders

Average of Recovery Rate (%) based on disease category: this explains the rate at which people recover based on age 

average healthcare access over the years with Age group : This explains the average age range that have access to healthcare over the years

Average Treatment Cost (USD) by disease category: This explains the cost to treat difeerent disease based on category

Average of Healthcare Access (%) by country: this shows the rate at which each country provide access to patients

sum of income per country (top 5): this shows how much income made based on each country


**Key findings:** 

•	Prevalence and Incidence Trends: Diseases like COVID-19 and Ebola showed varying rates of prevalence and incidence across      regions, with noticeable spikes in specific years.

•	Mortality and Recovery Rates: High mortality rates are associated with diseases such as Ebola, while diseases like COVID-19    had relatively high recovery rates in recent years.

•	Socioeconomic Correlations: Countries with higher per capita income and education indices tended to have lower disease         prevalence rates and higher vaccine availability.

•	Urbanization and Health: Urbanization rates appeared to impact the incidence of certain diseases, indicating a potential       link between urban density and health outcomes.

#PROJECT 3


**Title:** Company QTC staff records- **SQL** data manipulation and interogation 


**SQL Code:** [Company QTC SQL code](https://github.com/toby222a/toby222a.github.io/blob/main/comapny_staff_records.sql)


**SQL Skills Used:**


•	Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried and extracted specific information from the database.

•	Data Aggregation (COUNT): counted records to analyse data trends.

•	Data Filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, AND): Applied filters to select relevant data, including filtering by ranges and lists.

•	Data Source Specification (FROM): Specified the tables used as data sources for retrieval 

•	Query tool (Join, Left join)

•	String function (upper, lower, substring, char index,concat)

•	Wildcards (%)

•	Like operator 



**Project Description:** This project involves analyzing employee-related data to understand workforce distribution, salary trends, and position hierarchies. The goal is to derive insights into employee roles, their compensation, and tenure in the organization. The analysis uses SQL queries to handle data extraction, transformation, and insight generation. 

**the key findings are as follows:**

•Age Analysis: Found employees born between 02/05/1970 and 31/12/1995.
 
•	Employee Listing: Retrieved all employee records ordered by their last name.

•	Salary Range: Listed employees with salaries between 50,000 and 100,000.

**Observation and Area of Improvement**

• Department Distribution:
The HR and Admin departments have the highest number of employees (2 each), while the Account department has only 1 employee.

• Gender Distribution:
Male: 3 employees & Female: 2 employees

• Department and Project Balance:
The distribution of employees across departments and projects is uneven. Efforts could be made to balance the workforce more evenly across different departments and projects.
